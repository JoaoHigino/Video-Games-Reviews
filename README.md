## UX Design and Planning

During the planning of this project, I considered which features and functionality should be available to the user, and how to provide these whilst maximising the user experience.

### Home Page, Your Votes Page and Favourites Page

![Image showing home page wireframe](/src/assets/home-page-wireframe.png)

For the home page, I aimed to create a simple layout, that wasn't overwhelming for the user to use initially. I did this by having a brand logo and clear nav links at the top of the page, some basic filter controls and a post feed below. The main feed content is centralised, with the search bar and category filter controls above so the user can easily see and access them. I later decided that it would be better to include the 'Post' button alongside the category filter, rather than in the nav bar. By having the feed on the home page, it immediately makes the identity of the website clear to the user. The 'Your Votes' and 'Favourites' pages follow the same layout and design but only include posts that have been voted on or favourited by the logged in user.

![Image showing home page for logged in users wireframe](/src/assets/home-page-wireframe-logged-in.png)

The navbar responds to whether the user is logged in or not, by displaying the appropriate links. 

![Image showing the home page on a mobile device](/src/assets/home-page-mobile-wireframe.png)

The home page has a fully responsive layout which is also used throughout the pages on the website. The navbar is hidden and can be accessed by clicking the hamburger dropdown icon.

### Add Post Page

![Image showing the add post page wireframe](/src/assets/create-post-wireframe.png)

The 'Add Post' page aims to provide a simple form for users to create posts. The image preview was particularly important as it allows users to check their image before submitting the post; nd thus provide a better user experience.

### Edit Post Page

![Image showing the edit post page wireframe](/src/assets/edit-post-wireframe.png)

The 'Edit Post' page layout copies the 'Add Post' page layout to provide familiarity to the user. The previous data about the post is automatically displayed in the form when the user loads the page so that they can see the existing data for the post. This makes it easier for the user to update their post data.

### Profile Page

![Image showing the profile page](/src/assets/profile-wireframe.png)

The 'Profile' page information about a specific user. The central profile image, along with the profile title, clearly informs users whose profile they are visiting. The statistics section below, clearly provides information about the profile's activity. The centralised feed remains consistent with the layout of the other pages.

### Sign Up Page

![Image showing the sign up page](/src/assets/readmefiles/navbarsignin.png)

The 'Sign Up' page aims to provide a simple, attractive form for which users can register for an account.

### Sign In Page

![Image showing the sign in page](/src/assets/sign-in-wireframe.png)

The 'Sign In' page follows the same layout as the 'Sign Up' page and aims similarly aims to provide a simple, attractive form for which users can sign into their account.

### Profile Page

![Image showing the edit profile form](/src/assets/edit-profile-wireframe.png)

### Edit Profile Page

The 'Edit Profile' page allows users to change their profile image and description. Similarly to the 'Post Edit' page, the 'Edit Profile' form loads with the previous profile data filled. This provides a better user experience as users can easily update their data by changing the original. The profile image can also be previewed to allow users to check the image.

### Edit Username Page

![Image showing the edit username form](/src/assets/edit-username-wireframe.png)

The 'Edit Username' page aims to provide a simple, yet attractive form for users to update their usernames.

### Edit Password Page

![Image showing the edit password form](/src/assets/edit-password-wireframe.png)

The 'Edit Password' page aims to provide a simple, yet attractive form for users to update their passwords.

## User Stories

An agile development strategy was implemented in this project as user stories were created as 'Issues' on GitHub. Each user story prioritised b being assigned a level of necessity to be included in the project - 'Should-Have', 'Could-Have' or 'Must-Have' and seen can be seen as labels attached to the user stories. These user stories were then put onto a kanban board using 'GitHub Projects'. Here, user stories could be moved between 'To do', 'In progress (current sprint)' and 'Done' columns.

## Features

### Navigation 

- Displays the brand logo and name of the website to the user.
- A clear 'Open Sans' font is used to make the links visible to the user.
- A dark grey background color and white font color provides sufficient contrast so the links are clearly visible.
- A yellow hover effect also provides sufficient contrast and improves the user experience by showing that the links are clickable. 
- On screens sizes with sufficient space, 'Font Awesome' icons are used for extra clarity of the links. If space is limited, these links are hidden but the text remains.
- The active page's nav link appears yellow to indicate to the user which page they are currently viewing.
- Allows the user to navigate between pages on the website.
- On smaller screens, a hamburger icon appears and opens a dropdown menu when clicked, displaying all of the navbar links. This provides a better user experience as the navbar doesn't have to take up unnecessary space and it maximises the space for other content.
- On smaller screens, the navbar automatically closes after clicking a nav link or clicking off of the nav bar to provide a better users experience.
- Conditional rendering is used to display different nav links to users that are logged in and logged out. This limits users to being able to only use site functionality relevant to their log in status.
- Users are able to see their log in state in the navbar.
- Created using Bootstrap for a simple, responsive design.

## React Components

React components are blocks of code that are reusable throughout an application. Rather than categorising each page as a whole, each page can be broken down into parts, known as components. They are advantageous as they reduce the need for writing the same code multiple times for different pages. Large pages can often be quite complex, so working on a particular part (component) of a page independently can reduce complexity and the opportunity for making errors. Additionally, an error caused in a particular component will be isolated to itself so won't impact the whole site's functionality. Finally, components were used to easily provide a consistent and familiar theme and user experience across the website

### Asset

- Used to display a loading spinner that appears when users are waiting for content to load on the website, as well as a display a message for when no post results are found.
- The loading spinner improves the user experience as users are aware the content is loading and avoid becoming momentarily confused due to white space being present until content loads.
- The message improves the user experience as users are aware that the no results exist and don't waste time waiting for results that won't appear.

### Avatar

- Used to display user profile images, such as on posts, comments, profiles and the navbar.
- User experience improved as it allows consistent and familiar styling to be used throughout the application. It also allows users to be creative and feel unique with their profile.

### MoreDropdown

- Used to create a 3 dots icon that when clicked, would provide button links.
- MoreDropdown used on posts and comments, to allow the author to edit or delete their content.
- ProfileDropdown variation allows the profile owner to edit their profile or change their username and password.
- Improves the user experience as users become familiar with the 3 dot icon and assoicate it with allowing them to access more functionality on the site.
- Also improves the user experience by allowing supplementary content to be hidden from the main content. Thus, not keeping the laout simple and not overwhelming for the user.

### NavBar

- Used on every page to allow users to access different pages on the website.
- Forms a consistent part of the layout on every page to contribute to the website's identity.
- Improves the user experience as users are able to reach any page from any page and creating a sense of familiarity.

### PageNotFound

- Used to notify the user that the current URL path returns no content.
- Improves the user experience by providing feedback after an error, rather than leaving them to become confused.
- Navbar is displayed so that users can easily go to another page.

## Future Features

- Vote Percentage Bar 
    - Currently users can see which option is more popular on each post by comparing the number for each option. In the future a bar could be added to each post and two colours could be used to show the percentage of each vote option. The bar could move using a transition effect when a user adds a vote on a post. This would provide a more attractive graphic to users.
- Followers
    - At the beginning of this project I thought that having followers is unnecessary for this website. I still believe that the site funcitons sufficiently without the need of followers. However I can see how following profiles could make the site superior as users could also have a page to see the posts from users that they follow. This would provide an extra level to the custom experience on the site.
- Multiple Post Images
    - Currently users can post an individual image showing two options that can be voted for. In the future it may be easier for users to have the option to upload 2 individual images, rather than combining 2 images into 1.

    - running "npm start" in the terminal.
 
### Deploying to Heroku

During the development of the project, version control was used by committing and pushing the code to GitHub. The GitHub repository can be found here: https://github.com/JoaoHigino/video-games-reviews

This project was deployed to Heroku by:
- Committing and pushing the code to GitHub.
- Logging in to your Heroku account at Heroku.com.
- On the Heroku website, clicking 'New' and then 'Create New App'.
- Setting the name and region and pressing 'Create App'.
- Clicking the 'Deploy' tab.
- Clicking 'Connect to GitHub', search for repository, click 'Connect'.
- Enabling Manual Deploy. Check for successful message.
- Enabling Automatic Deploys.
- The live site can be found here: https://video-games-reviews.herokuapp.com/

### Connecting to the API

In axiosDefaults.js, the "axios.defaults.baseURL" variable needs to be set to the string 'https://video-games-reviews.herokuapp.com/' (deployed API URL). This sets the front end website to make requests to the specifc API built in this project. Additionally, the backend API project on Heroku needs a config var of "Client_ORIGIN" and the value of "https://video-games-reviews-api.herokuapp.com/" (deployed site URL). This allows the front end website to make requests to the API.
