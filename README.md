## UX Design and Planning

During the planning of this project, I considered which features and functionality should be available to the user, and how to provide these whilst maximising the user experience.

## Project Goals

A react frontend website and django backend API. Linked together to provide full CRUD functionality. 

A site that is accessed via login and provides users with the features of creating posts and comments and editing their profile and superpowers. 

### The factors in setting these goals:

- Entry level knowledge and understanding of creating a React frontend and API backend.

### Project goals:

|No.|Goal|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1|Log in/log out/Sign up | User can create an account and login or log out|
|2|Posts page styled with video games theme | A responsive homepage with post CRUD functionality|
|3|Comments | Comments for each post with CRUD functionality|
|4|Profiles (Created on new account) | Profiles with full CRUD Functionality |
|5| Front-end react website and custom built API| Hosted on Heroku |
|6| Deployment of final website to Heroku | Upon project completion | 
|7| Document all known bugs and issues | Ensure documentation is clear and honest |

## User Stories

An agile development strategy was implemented in this project as user stories were created as 'Issues' on GitHub. Each user story prioritised b being assigned a level of necessity to be included in the project - 'Should-Have', 'Could-Have' or 'Must-Have' and seen can be seen as labels attached to the user stories. These user stories were then put onto a kanban board using 'GitHub Projects'. Here, user stories could be moved between 'To do', 'In progress (current sprint)', 'Done'and 'Won't do' columns.

## React Components

React components are blocks of code that are reusable throughout an application. Rather than categorising each page as a whole, each page can be broken down into parts, known as components. They are advantageous as they reduce the need for writing the same code multiple times for different pages. Large pages can often be quite complex, so working on a particular part (component) of a page independently can reduce complexity and the opportunity for making errors. Additionally, an error caused in a particular component will be isolated to itself so won't impact the whole site's functionality. Finally, components were used to easily provide a consistent and familiar theme and user experience across the website

### Avatar

- Used to display user profile images, such as on posts, comments, profiles and the navbar.

- User experience improved as it allows consistent and familiar styling to be used throughout the application. It also allows users to be creative and feel unique with their profile.

### MoreDropdown

- Used to create a 3 dots icon that when clicked, would provide button links.

- MoreDropdown used on posts and comments, to allow the author to edit or delete their content.

- ProfileDropdown variation allows the profile owner to edit their profile or change their username and password.

- Also improves the user experience by allowing supplementary content to be hidden from the main content. Thus, not keeping the laout simple and not overwhelming for the user.

### NavBar

- Used on every page to allow users to access different pages on the website.

- Forms a consistent part of the layout on every page to contribute to the website's identity.

- Improves the user experience as users are able to reach any page from any page and creating a sense of familiarity.

### PageNotFound

- Used to notify the user that the current URL path returns no content.

- Improves the user experience by providing feedback after an error, rather than leaving them to become confused.

## Future Features

- To be able to search for a user instead of only search for a post.

- Create a rating system to the posts.

- Create categories like Playstation/Xbox/Twitch/PC.

## Deployment 

### Run Locally

Note that the API will also have to configured to allow access to local hosts.

- Manually Downloading the Repository:

    - Opening the project repository at: https://github.com/JoaoHigino/video-games-reviews

    - Opening the dropdown on the 'code' button.

    - Downloading the zip file.

    - Extracting the files from the zip file into a new folder on your computer.

    - Opening the folder in an IDE of your choice.

    - Updating the the "start" script value to "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start".

    - running "npm install" in the terminal.

    - running "npm start" in the terminal.

- Cloning the Repository:

    - Opening the project repository at: https://github.com/JoaoHigino/video-games-reviews

    - Opening the dropdown on the 'code' button.

    - Copying the link under the HTTPS heading (https://github.com/JoaoHigino/video-games-reviews.git).

    - Opening an IDE of your choice (must have Git support or relevant git extension).

    - Open the terminal and create a directory to store the repository.

    - Type "git clone https://github.com/JoaoHigino/video-games-reviews.git" and press enter in the terminal.

    - Updating the the "start" script value to "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start".

    - running "npm install" in the terminal.

    - running "npm start" in the terminal.
 
### Deploying to Heroku

During the development of the project, version control was used by committing and pushing the code to GitHub. The GitHub repository can be found here: https://github.com/JoaoHigino/video-games-reviews

This project was deployed to Heroku by:

- Committing and pushing the code to GitHub.

- Logging in to your Heroku account at Heroku.com.

- On the Heroku website, clicking 'New' and then 'Create New App'.

- Setting the name and region and pressing 'Create App'.

- Clicking the 'Deploy' tab.

- Clicking 'Connect to GitHub', search for repository, click 'Connect'.

- Enabling Manual Deploy. Check for successful message.

- Enabling Automatic Deploys.

- The live site can be found here: https://video-games-reviews.herokuapp.com/

### Connecting to the API

In axiosDefaults.js, the "axios.defaults.baseURL" variable needs to be set to the string 'https://video-games-reviews.herokuapp.com/' (deployed API URL). This sets the front end website to make requests to the specifc API built in this project. Additionally, the backend API project on Heroku needs a config var of "Client_ORIGIN" and the value of "https://video-games-reviews-api.herokuapp.com/" (deployed site URL). This allows the front end website to make requests to the API.
